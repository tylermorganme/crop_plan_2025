Check the quality of the code you just created. Does everything mirror existing patterns. Do we cleaning transform any imported data and ingest it through production CRUD operations to prevent duplciate code. Do we using existing state patterns to ensure we have persistence and undo/redo where appropriate. Did we add any cruft? Do all UI patterns and layouts match the standards used in the rest of the code base?
