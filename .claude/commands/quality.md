The goal of this application is to be entirely data driven. We change the data and the UI changes. Unerdlying inputs change, derived state changes in one place and one place only and all views read from that single source of truth. Check the quality of the code you just created. Does everything use existing state when possible and mirror existing patterns? Do we using existing state patterns to ensure we have persistence and undo/redo where appropriate. Did we add any cruft? Do all UI patterns and layouts match the standards used in the rest of the code base?
